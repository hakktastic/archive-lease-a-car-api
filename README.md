# lease a Car Api

This is a  simple microservices application which calculates the lease rate for a given car and customer.

#### Background
I started developing this application as an assessment for a Job application. Before I wasn't familiar with the concepts & technologies. In order to be able to build this application I also took two online courses:

* [Master Java Web Services and RESTful API with Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-web-services-tutorial/)
* [Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud/)

I completed the first course and I'm currently progressing the second course (Spring Cloud). So far so good and I'm really enjoying it!
